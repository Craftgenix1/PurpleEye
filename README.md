# PurpleEye
An upcoming mod for mindustry

# PLAN: 


## 1. liquids in core
- might add blocks for packaging/unpackaging liquids, unless there's an easier way

## 2. Drills only need 1 output [maybe would require a block to place over/around the drills]
- would try to find area, output to singular block that initiates check[?]

## 3. Item sources, item sinks, item resevoirs
- Sources: take from resevoirs
- Sinks: add to resevoirs
- Resevoirs: store from sinks and give to sources, can only hold one type of resource

- Upgrades:
  - base item speed: undecided
  - base item capacity: 2,000 for resevoir, 100 for the other two

## 4. a way to get any resource in any sector
- would add a factory block for every resource that isn't solely made through other resources [sorry metaglass]

## 5. uhhh...
