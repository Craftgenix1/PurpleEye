# PurpleEye
An upcoming mod for mindustry

# PLAN: 


## 1. New core blocks- Core tanks!
- new upgrade path for the serpulo core!
  - Core: Cistern
      - the T1 core, higher carrying capacity, health, and [potentially] armor than the core, can carry liquids
      - T1 unit: [undefined] has upgraded mining speed, carrying capacity, moving speed, building speed, and damage- new mechanic: split unit functions- will have an 'attack' mode and a 'build mode, activated by proximity to enemy units, the top half will activate it's weapons and stop building, meanwhile the bottom half will keep building [albeit at a slower pace] and will not prioritize staying close to what it's building
        
  - Core: Kilderkin the T2 core, upgrades off of T1
    - T2 unit: upgrades off of the T1 unit
      
  - Core: Puncheon the T3 core, not the end of it
    - T3 unit: the T3 unit, far from over
    
  - Core: Demijohn the T4 core, even more storage
    - T4 unit: the first [that I know of] T4 core unit
      
  - Core: Chulton the T5 core, the final tier [for now] sports massive size, and even more storage. for true colonizers only.
    - T5 unit: the final core unit. surprisingly spry.

    
## 2. Drills only need 1 output [maybe would require a block to place over/around the drills]
- would try to find area, output to singular block that initiates check[?]

## 3. Item sources, item sinks, item resevoirs
- Sources: take from resevoirs
- Sinks: add to resevoirs
- Resevoirs: store from sinks and give to sources, can only hold one type of resource

- Upgrades:
  - base item speed: undecided
  - base item capacity: 2,000 per resevoir, 100 for the other two

## 4. A way to get any resource in any sector
- would add a factory block for every resource that isn't solely made through other resources [sorry metaglass]

## 5. Smart walls
- would make it so that walls would automatically combine, would remove 'large' varients of walls however

## 6. unit-powered power source
- probably just going to be something you can click that outputs power every time you click it- used for starting up perpetual power plants, might even let out an arc of electricity if you click it without attaching it to anythuing else [damages enemy units [not a lot], does not damage ally buildings]

## 7. uhhh...
