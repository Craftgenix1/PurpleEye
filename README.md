# PurpleEye
An upcoming mod for mindustry

# PLAN: 


## 1. liquids in core
- making a new path of cores that will have their own 'type' which will handle this

## 2. Drills only need 1 output [maybe would require a block to place over/around the drills]
- would try to find area, output to singular block that initiates check[?]

## 3. Item sources, item sinks, item resevoirs
- Sources: take from resevoirs
- Sinks: add to resevoirs
- Resevoirs: store from sinks and give to sources, can only hold one type of resource

- Upgrades:
  - base item speed: undecided
  - base item capacity: 2,000 per resevoir, 100 for the other two

## 4. A way to get any resource in any sector
- would add a factory block for every resource that isn't solely made through other resources [sorry metaglass]

## 5. Smart walls
- would make it so that walls would automatically combine, would remove 'large' varients of walls however

## 6. unit-powered power source
- probably just going to be something you can click that outputs power every time you click it- used for starting up perpetual power plants, might even let out an arc of electricity if you click it without attaching it to anythuing else [damages enemy units [not a lot], does not damage ally buildings]

## 7. uhhh...
