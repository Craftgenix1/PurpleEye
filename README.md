# PurpleEye
An upcoming mod for mindustry
# PLAN: 
## 1. liquids in core
- might add blocks for packaging/unpackaging liquids, unless there's an easier way
## 2. Drills only need 1 output [maybe would require a block to place over/around the drills]
- would try to find area, output to singular block that initiates check[?]
## 3. Item sources, item sinks, item resevoirs
- Sources: take from resevoirs
- Sinks: add to resevoirs
- Resevoirs: store from sources and give to sinks, can only hold one type of resource
## 4. uhhh...
